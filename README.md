#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering



Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is all about writing instructions ie code, building, testing and maintaining software that make our lives better

software engineering is important in the tech industry as it drives innovation by enabling the creation of new technologies, applications and  solutions that improve our lives eg in healthcare.
Software engineering principles allow for software that can scale to accommodate growth and be maintained effectively over time.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birt of software engineering (1968). At a NATO conference the word software engineering was used to address the growing software crisis where the need to build better software was growing.

Structured programming (1970s). During this era software developers started using structured programming techniques to make software more readable and organized.

Rise of Agile and devOps( 2000s to present). During this era agile development became popular. The focus was on fast, flexible software releses. DevOps introduced automation in order to streamline development and deployment.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a step by step process of building software. The steps are;

Problem analysis; this step involves getting input from all stakeholders inorder to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with inprovement as the end goal.

Planning; this step involves determining the cost and resources required for impelmenting what is required. 

Design stage; during this phase the software specifications are turned into a design plan called the Design specification. All stakeholders review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions.

Building stage; during this stage the actual software development is dpne and the developer should stick to the agreed blue print and ensure proper guidelines about the code style and pratices are in place.

Code test; during this stage test for defects on deficiencies are done and fixed to ensure smooth execution.

Software deployment; at this stage the software is released so that users can start using the product. Some organisations release it in phases. 

Software maintenance; in reality the product never turns out perfect and conditions in real world change hence need to update and advance software to match.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall; a step by step linear process where each phase is completed before moving to the next. This method works best for projects with clear, fixed requirements e.g building software for a medical technology where changes are risky.

Agile; this is more flexible and work is done in small cycles called sprints. This method is great for projects where requirements might change e.g developing a mobile app where user feedback might needupdats to be done.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer; responsible for writing  and maintaining code for software and collaborates with the software team to build it.

Quality Assurance Engineer; responsible for testing sftware, finding bugs and ensuring the software works as expected.

Project manager; responsible for organizing tasks, keeping the software team on track and ensuring deadlines are met.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated development environments (IDEs); a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.
IDEs are important  because they help developers write, test and debug code in one place. The have built in tools like code completion and error checking. examples; Visual Studio Code.

Version Control Systems (VCS); are softwares that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. VCS are important because helps teams track code changes, collaborate and rollback if neede. examples include; Git which has platforms like github and gitlab



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging; this is finding and fixing bugs in code which is time consuming. Can overcome this challenge by using debugging tools, writing clear logs and testing code often.

Meeting tight deadlines; software developers sre pressured to release software quickly inorder to overcome this they can prioritize tasks and automate repetitive work.

Changes; clients tend to change their minds about the requirements mid-orject inorder to overcome this use Agile to adapt and also document everything properly for easier follow up.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing; this involves testing individual pieces of code to ensure they work properly e,g a single function

Integartion testing; this involves checking if differents parts of a software work well together.

System Testing; thsi involves veryfying the entire system to ensure it meets the rquirements.

Acceptance testing; thsi is final testing done to confirm that the software is ready for users.

Testing is important in sofwtare quallity assurance in order to prevent major issues before release, ensure smooth sofwtare perfomance and guarantee user satisfaction.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is giving instructions to Ai asking it to do something in the right way by writing a prompt so that it can give you a useful answer.

Prompt engineering is important so that AI can do exactly what you need it to by knowing how to talk to it. Prompt engineering ensures accuracy. A clear prompt avoids confusion and gets staright to the point. It also saves time since no need to keep rephrasing or asking again.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt; Tell me how to move to another country?

Improved prompt; tell me how i can move to japan, the types of visas and their requirements.

The second prompt is more effective because it narrows down tghe focus to a specific country Japan. It asks a specific issue to cover Visas and their requiremnts. The improved prompt is better because it is clear, concise and specific.
